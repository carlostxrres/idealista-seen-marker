# idealista-seen-marker
A TamperMonkey script to flag seen properties in idealista.com.

## To do
- [ ] On UI seen-banner:
   - [ ] Show when the property was seen for the last time
   - [ ] Add an option to "set as unseen" on property nodes (on click?)
- [ ] Allow real-time flagging
- [ ] Migrate this to a Firefox add-on
- [ ] Add "reset storage" option
